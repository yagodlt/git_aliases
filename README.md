GIT ALIASES readme

This is a list of git aliases that I use nearly every day.

I hope it's useful to you. If you want to contribute, send
me a pull request.


INSTALLATION

For UNIX-like systems (Mac and Linux) these aliases need to 
be added to either ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile.

The easiest way to edit these files is to use any text editor.

In order to see the changes you must tell your machine to load
them. To do that you can either log out and log back in or 
use the command 'source ~/.bashrc' (or 'source ~/.bash_profile'
if you chose to put them there)

Enjoy!
